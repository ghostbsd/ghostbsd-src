.Sh NAME
.Nm tacplus.conf
.Nd TACACS+ client configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /etc/tacplus.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains the information necessary to configure the TACACS+ client
library.
It is parsed by
.Fn tac_config
(see
.Xr libtacplus 3 ) .
The file contains one or more lines of text, each describing a
single TACACS+ server which is to be used by the library.
Leading
white space is ignored, as are empty lines and lines containing
only comments.
.Pp
A TACACS+ server is described by two to four fields on a line.
The
fields are separated by white space.
The
.Ql #
character at the beginning of a field begins a comment, which extends
to the end of the line.
A field may be enclosed in double quotes,
in which case it may contain white space and/or begin with the
.Ql #
character.
Within a quoted string, the double quote character can
be represented by
.Ql \e\&" ,
and the backslash can be represented by
.Ql \e\e .
No other escape sequences are supported.
.Pp
The first field specifies
the server host, either as a fully qualified domain name or as a
dotted-quad IP address.
The host may optionally be followed by a
.Ql \&:
and a numeric port number, without intervening white space.
If the
port specification is omitted, it defaults to 49, the standard TACACS+
port.
.Pp
The second field contains the shared secret, which should be known
only to the client and server hosts.
It is an arbitrary string
of characters, though it must be enclosed in double quotes if it
contains white space or is empty.
An empty secret disables the
normal encryption mechanism, causing all data to cross the network in
cleartext.
.Pp
The third field contains a decimal integer specifying the timeout
in seconds for communicating with the server.
The timeout applies
separately to each connect, write, and read operation.
If this field
is omitted, it defaults to 3 seconds.
.Pp
The optional fourth field may contain the string
.Ql single-connection .
If this option is included, the library will attempt to negotiate
with the server to keep the TCP connection open for multiple
sessions.
Some older TACACS+ servers become confused if this option
is specified.
.Pp
Up to 10 TACACS+ servers may be specified.
The servers are tried in
order, until a valid response is received or the list is exhausted.
.Pp
The standard location for this file is
.Pa /etc/tacplus.conf .
An alternate pathname may be specified in the call to
.Fn tac_config
(see
.Xr libtacplus 3 ) .
Since the file contains sensitive information in the form of the
shared secrets, it should not be readable except by root.
