.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_opieaccess
.Nd OPIEAccess PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_opieaccess
.Op Ar options
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
OPIE is deprecated, and may not be available in
.Fx 14.0
and later.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is used in conjunction with the
.Xr pam_opie 8
PAM module to ascertain that authentication can proceed by other means
(such as the
.Xr pam_unix 8
module) even if OPIE authentication failed.
To properly use this module,
.Xr pam_opie 8
should be marked
.Dq Li sufficient ,
and
.Nm
should be listed right below it and marked
.Dq Li requisite .
.Pp
The
.Nm
module provides functionality for only one PAM category:
authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides null functions for the remaining module types.
.Ss OPIEAccess Authentication Module
The authentication component
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
returns
.Dv PAM_SUCCESS
in two cases:
.Bl -enum
.It
The user does not have OPIE enabled.
.It
The user has OPIE enabled, and the remote host is listed as a trusted
host in
.Pa /etc/opieaccess ,
and the user does not have a file named
.Pa \&.opiealways
in his home directory.
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, it returns
.Dv PAM_AUTH_ERR .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm allow_local"
.It Cm allow_local
Normally, local logins are subjected to the same restrictions as
remote logins from
.Dq localhost .
This option causes
.Nm
to always allow local logins.
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm no_warn
suppress warning messages to the user.
These messages include reasons why the user's authentication attempt
was declined.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa $HOME/.opiealways"
.It Pa /etc/opieaccess
List of trusted hosts or networks.
See
.Xr opieaccess 5
for a description of its syntax.
.It Pa $HOME/.opiealways
The presence of this file makes OPIE mandatory for the user.
