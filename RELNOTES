422084abbda:
	LLVM's MemorySanitizer can now be used in amd64 kernels.  See the
	kmsan(9) manual page for more information.

38da497a4dfc:
	LLVM's AddressSanitizer can now be used in amd64 kernels.  See the
	kasan(9) manual page for more information.

f39dd6a97844,23f24377b1a9,628bd30ab5a4:
	One True Awk has been updated to the latest from upstream
	(20210727). All the FreeBSD patches, but one, have now been
	either up streamed or discarded.  Notable changes include:
		o Locale is no longer used for ranges
		o Various bugs fixed
		o Better compatibility with gawk and mawk

	The one FreeBSD change, likely to be removed in FreeBSD 14, is that
	we still allow hex numbers, prefixed with 0x, to be parsed and
	interpreted as hex numbers while all other awks (including one
	true awk now) interpret them as 0 in line with awk's historic
	behavior.

	A second change, less likely to be noticed, is the historic wart
	if -Ft meaning to use hard tab characters as the field separator
	is deprecated and will likely be removed in FreeBSD 14.

ee29e6f31111:
	Commit ee29e6f31111 added a new sysctl called vfs.nfsd.srvmaxio
	that can be used to increase the maximum I/O size for the NFS
	server to any power of 2 up to 1Mbyte while the nfsd(8) is not running.
	The FreeBSD NFS client can now be set to use a 1Mbyte I/O size
	via the vfs.maxbcachebuf tunable and the Linux NFS client
	can also do 1Mbyte I/O.
	kern.ipc.maxsockbuf will need to be increased.  A console
	message will suggest a setting for it.

d575e81fbcfa:
	gconcat(8) has added support for appending devices to the device
	not present at creation time.

76681661be28:
	Remove support for asymmetric cryptographic operations from
	the kernel open cryptographic framework (OCF).

a145cf3f73c7:
	The NFSv4 client now uses the highest minor version of NFSv4
	supported by the NFSv4 server by default instead of minor version 0,
	for NFSv4 mounts.
	The "minorversion" mount option may be used to override this default.
