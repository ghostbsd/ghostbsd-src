.Sh NAME
.Nm terasic_mtl
.Nd driver for the Terasic/Cambridge Multi-Touch LCD device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device terasic_mtl"

.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.terasic_mtl.0.at="nexus0"
.Cd hint.terasic_mtl.0.reg_maddr=0x70400000

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for the Terasic Multi-Touch LCD combined as
controlled by a University of Cambridge's IP Core.
Three device nodes are instantiated, representing various services supported
by the device:
.Bl -tag -width terasic_pixelX
.It terasic_regX
Memory-mapped register interface, including touch screen input.
.It terasic_pixelX
Memory-mapped pixel-oriented frame buffer.
.It terasic_textX
Memory-mapped text-oriented frame buffer.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
devices are also attached to the
.Xr syscons 4
framework, which implements a VT-compatible terminal connected to the
.Xr tty 4
framework.
.Li ttyvX
device nodes may be added to
.Xr ttys 5
in order to launch
.Xr login 1
sessions at boot.
.Pp
Register, text, and pixel devices may be accessed using
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2
system calls, and also memory mapped using
.Xr mmap 2 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 10.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
device driver and this manual page were
developed by SRI International and the University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory under DARPA/AFRL contract
.Pq FA8750-10-C-0237
.Pq Do CTSRD Dc ,
as part of the DARPA CRASH research programme.
This device driver was written by
.An Robert N. M. Watson .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Xr syscons 4
attachment does not support the hardware cursor feature.
.Pp
A more structured interface to control registers using the
.Xr ioctl 2
system call, would sometimes be preferable to memory mapping.
For touch screen input, it would be highly desirable to offer a streaming
interface whose events can be managed using
.Xr poll 2
and related system calls, with the kernel performing polling rather than the
userspace application.
.Pp
.Nm
supports only a
.Li nexus
bus attachment, which is appropriate for system-on-chip busses such as
Altera's Avalon bus.
If the IP core is configured off of another bus type, then additional bus
attachments will be required.
