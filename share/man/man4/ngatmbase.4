.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides utility functions for the handling of signalling
messages to the NgATM modules.
.Pp
The
.Fn uni_msg_pack_mbuf
function
packs a message into one or several
.Vt mbuf Ns s
optionally prepending a header.
The header is given by its address
.Fa hdr
and length
.Fa len .
If
.Fa hdr
is
.Dv NULL
or
.Fa len
equals 0, no header is prepended.
Either
.Fa msg
or
.Fa hdr
may be
.Dv NULL
but not both.
The
.Fn uni_msg_pack_mbuf
function
returns a pointer to the allocated
.Vt mbuf
chain or
.Dv NULL
in the case of an error.
.Pp
The
.Fn uni_msg_alloc
function
allocates a new message with space for at least
.Fa len
bytes.
In the case of an error
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn uni_msg_build
function constructs a message from pieces.
Each piece is given by a pair of
arguments, the first of type
.Vt "void *"
and the second a
.Vt size_t .
The list of pieces must be terminated by
.Po Vt "void *" Pc Ns Dv NULL .
.Pp
The
.Fn uni_msg_destroy
function
destroys the messages and frees all the messages's memory.
.Pp
The
.Fn uni_msg_unpack_mbuf
function
unpacks an
.Vt mbuf
chain info a
.Vt uni_msg .
A pointer to the newly allocated message is stored in
.Fa msgp
and 0 is returned.
In the case of an error (either when no packet header is found
in the first mbuf or memory cannot be allocated) the function
returns an appropriate error code.
