.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_atmllc
.Nd ATM LLC netgraph node type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_atmllc.h
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
.Nm
is deprecated and may not be available in
.Fx 14.0
and later.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atmllc
node type translates frames in to and out of ATM LLC encapsulation,
as specified by RFC 1483.
In LLC encapsulation the protocol of a given protocol data unit (PDU) is
specified by an IEEE 802.2 LLC header, possibly followed by an IEEE 802.1a
SubNetwork Attachment Point (SNAP) header.
This node currently handles the Ethernet and FDDI protocols.
.Pp
The node transmits and receives ATM PDUs on the
.Va atm
hook.
Received PDUs are decoded and forwarded to the
.Va ether
or
.Va fddi
hooks as appropriate.
Data received on the
.Va ether
or
.Va fddi
hooks are assumed to be full Ethernet or FDDI packets as appropriate and are
encapsulated into a PDU and transmitted via the
.Va atm
hook.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports the following hooks:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va ether"
.It Va atm
ATM connection.
Typically, this hook would be connected to a
.Xr ng_atm 4
node, which handles transmission of ATM PDUs over an ATM device.
.It Va ether
Ethernet connection.
This hook sends and receives Ethernet frames.
This would normally be connected to an
.Xr ng_eiface 4
node if in use.
.It Va fddi
FDDI connection.
This hook sends and receives FDDI frames.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type supports the generic control messages.
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message, or when all hooks have been disconnected.
