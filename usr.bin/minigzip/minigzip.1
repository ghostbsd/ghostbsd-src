compression and decompression of individual files, as well as
streaming compression and decompression via standard input and

The default operation is compression, decompression can be
selected by supplying the

.Pa .gz
suffix if one is present.

reads from standard input and writes the results of the operation

writes the results to standard output and keep the original files
unchanged.
